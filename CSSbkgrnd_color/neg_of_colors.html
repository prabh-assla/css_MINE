            On 15th of August, 1947, India became an independent country. At
            this time, the country didn't have a constitution of its own. On 28th
            of August, 1947, a drafting committee with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar as
            the head had been appointed to draft a permanent constitution for
            the country.

            Subsequently the drafting committee submitted its
            first report on 4th of Nov, 1947. Followed by discussions and
            revisions, the report was then signed by the Constituent Assembly
            on 24th of Jan, 1950.

            Two days later, on 26th of Jan, 1950, the
            constitution came into effect. Now, India stands as a truly sovereign
            country with a constitution of its own.

            Designed by the inventor of the radio, “Marconi” and managed by
            “The Wireless and Telegraph Company” which was owned by 
            Marconi himself, radio signaling system of the Titanic must had
            been one of the most powerful of that time. Adding to features of
            radio signaling, all messages were sent wirelessly via Morse Code
            and could be accessed by anybody on that particular frequency.

            Even after having one of the most powerful radio signaling system,
            the reason Titanic collided with iceberg may be that the operators
            on the Titanic were busy handling the communication of high-
            profile passengers on board and hence could not receive warnings
            about the iceberg.

            Another reason may be that many ships received  
            the distress call from the Titanic, but the messages were being
            transmitted and retransmitted, leading to a confusion in the
            messages. Sadly when the disaster struck, help couldn't reach the
            Titanic on time. The ship sank and many lives were lost.
