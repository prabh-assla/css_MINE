	<div class="poem">

	 manifestation of
<br> free mentality,
<br> a voice of heart
<br> that was meant to be free;
<br> not a strangled pigeon;
<br> crying,
<br> helpless,
<br> unsure of help!
<br> 
<br> thoughts that weren't
<br> restricted to cottage houses
<br> filled with discarded furniture
<br> and untidy floors;
<br> broken crockery
<br> and noisy doors;
<br> no electricity and weak walls,
<br> no water and no well-functioning clocks!
<br> 
<br> my glimmer has strengthened again
<br> as i shine in this darkness
<br> of void individuals,
<br> people with dead brains
<br> and caged souls,
<br> killing everyone who seems
<br> senseful and positive;
<br> differences are judged,
<br> happiness is cringed upon,
<br> love is criminilized,
<br> and peace is tagged as pollution,
<br> and freedom a poison!
<br> 
<br> but my glimmer won't fade,
<br> neither my revolt for freedom;
<br> from the depth of darkness
<br> i will rise,
<br> from the depth of ignorance
<br> i will rise,
<br> because this is what human was
<br> meant to be
<br> THE ONE
<br> TRUE FREE BEING!
