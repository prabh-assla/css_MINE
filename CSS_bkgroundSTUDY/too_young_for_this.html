        <h3> DEAD SOULS! </h3>

        as i shout
<br>    those 
<br>    sad lyrics 
<br>    onto the nakedness 
<br>    of those cold walled rooms,
<br>    the memories of those 
<br>    who deceased 
<br>    or left me
<br>    keep on dehydrating my lips,
<br>    as i starve 
<br>    of kisses and caressing hands;
<br>    starve of love and hope in general;
<br>    my laughter diminishing into
<br>    silence which is being
<br>    raped by irregular heart beats
<br>    of my decaying heart;
<br>    "while"
<br>    they keep on smiling 
<br>    looking how joyous 
<br>    i have become
<br>    without them;
<br>    but little did they know,
<br>    the yellow joy they see
<br>    is nothing worth to me;
<br>    "while"
<br>    living their happiness 
<br>    in a static phase,
<br>    a constant depressing phase;
<br>    as they remain stuck 
<br>    to all those 
<br>    paint-less ugly old walls,
<br>    walls that 
<br>    sheltered artifacts;
<br>    sheltered floors —
<br>    covered with 
<br>    now burnt oxygen that once travelled the
<br>    viens of all those depressed souls who died in that room...
<br>    those ROUGH walls —
<br>    weakened 
<br>    hopeless
<br>    strength-less
<br>    stare at me...
<br>    while i
<br>    attempt to relock the door 
<br>    once again
<br>    to come back again
<br>    after zillion of years...
