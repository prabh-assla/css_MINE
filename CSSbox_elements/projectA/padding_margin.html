					as i shout
			<br>	sad lyrics 
			<br>	those
			<br>	onto the nakedness  
			<br>	of those cold walled rooms,
			<br>	the memories of those 
			<br>	who deceased 
			<br>	or left me
			<br>	keep on dehydrating my lips,
			<br>	as i starve 
			<br>	of kisses and caressing hands;
			<br>	starve of love and hope in general;
		</div>

		<div class = "p2">
			<br>	my laughter diminishing into
			<br>	silence which is being
			<br>	raped by irregular heart beats
			<br>	of my decaying heart;
			<br>	"while"
			<br>	they keep on smiling 
			<br>	looking how joyous 
			<br>	i have become
			<br>	without them;
			<br>	but little did they know,
			<br>	the yellow joy they see
			<br>	is nothing worth to me;
		</div>

		<div class = "p3">
			<br>	"while"
			<br>	living their happiness 
			<br>	in a static phase,
			<br>	a constant depressing phase;
			<br>	as they remain stuck 
			<br>	to all those 
			<br>	paint-less ugly old walls,
			<br>	walls that 
			<br>	sheltered artifacts;
			<br>	sheltered floors —
			<br>	covered with 
			<br>	now burnt oxygen that once travelled the
			<br>	viens of all those depressed souls who died in that room...
		</div>

		<div class = "p4">
			<br>	those ROUGH walls —
			<br>	weakened 
			<br>	hopeless
			<br>	strength-less
			<br>	stare at me...
			<br>	while i
			<br>	attempt to relock the door 
			<br>	once again
			<br>	to come back again
			<br>	after zillion of years...
